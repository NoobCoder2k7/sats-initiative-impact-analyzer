# Metrics Definitions
## SATS Initiative Impact Analyzer

### Primary Business Metrics

#### 1. Incremental Demand Lift (%)
**Definition**: Percentage change in meal consumption attributable to the initiative, 
isolated from seasonal and baseline trends.

**Calculation**:
```
Incremental Lift = ((Treatment_Post - Treatment_Pre) - (Control_Post - Control_Pre)) / Control_Pre × 100
```

**Interpretation**:
- Positive value: Initiative increased demand efficiency
- Negative value: Initiative reduced waste (fewer meals needed)
- Example: -8.5% means initiative reduced required meals by 8.5%

**Target**: -8% to -12% (waste reduction while maintaining service)

---

#### 2. Waste Reduction (Units & SGD)
**Definition**: Decrease in uneaten meals (units) and associated cost savings (SGD).

**Calculation**:
```
Waste Units = meals_produced - meals_consumed
Waste Cost (SGD) = Waste Units × cost_per_meal
Monthly Savings = (Baseline_Waste_Cost - Post_Initiative_Waste_Cost) × 30 days
```

**Target**: 
- 15-20% reduction in waste units
- $40K-60K monthly cost savings (Singapore operations)

---

#### 3. Revenue Impact (SGD)
**Definition**: Financial value generated from improved meal planning and service quality.

**Components**:
- Direct savings: Reduced waste disposal costs
- Indirect savings: Less overproduction = lower procurement costs
- Service value: Maintained/improved passenger satisfaction (no shortages)

**Calculation**:
```
Revenue Impact = Waste Savings + Procurement Savings + (Service_Level × Penalty_Avoidance)
```

**Target**: $50K-70K monthly total revenue impact

---

#### 4. Return on Investment (ROI)
**Definition**: Ratio of financial benefit to initiative cost.

**Calculation**:
```
ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Initiative Cost) / Initiative Cost
```

**Components**:
- Benefit: Waste savings + procurement savings (annualized)
- Cost: Algorithm development + training + implementation

**Target**: >10x ROI (every $1 invested generates $10+ return)

---

### Secondary Operational Metrics

#### 5. Forecast Accuracy (%)
**Definition**: How closely predicted demand matches actual consumption.

**Calculation**:
```
Forecast Accuracy = 1 - (|Actual - Forecast| / Actual) × 100
```

**Target**: 
- Baseline: 88%
- Post-initiative: 94%+

---

#### 6. Service Level (%)
**Definition**: Percentage of flights where meal demand was fully met (no shortages).

**Calculation**:
```
Service Level = (Flights with meals_produced ≥ meals_consumed) / Total Flights × 100
```

**Target**: ≥95% (maintain or improve during waste reduction)

---

#### 7. Statistical Significance
**Definition**: Probability that observed effects are real, not random chance.

**Method**: 
- Difference-in-differences regression with 95% confidence intervals
- p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance

**Reporting**:
- Effect estimate (e.g., -8.5% waste reduction)
- Confidence interval (e.g., [-10.2%, -6.8%])
- Significance indicator (✓ or ✗)

---

### Data Quality Metrics

#### 8. Data Quality Score (%)
**Definition**: Composite score measuring data reliability.

**Components**:
- Completeness: % non-null in critical fields (target: 98%+)
- Accuracy: % passing business rule validation (target: 95%+)
- Timeliness: Data age <24 hours (target: 100%)
- Consistency: % valid foreign keys (target: 99%+)

**Overall Score**: Average of component scores

---

### Experiment-Specific Metrics

#### 9. Treatment Effect
**Definition**: Difference in outcomes between treatment and control groups in post-period.

**Formula**:
```
Treatment Effect = Avg(Treatment_Post) - Avg(Control_Post)
```

**Usage**: Isolates initiative impact from external factors

---

#### 10. Baseline Comparison
**Definition**: Performance delta vs. pre-initiative period.

**Formula**:
```
Baseline Improvement = (Post_Period_Avg - Pre_Period_Avg) / Pre_Period_Avg × 100
```

**Note**: Can be misleading due to seasonality; use DiD for causal interpretation

---

### Reporting Cadence

**Daily**: Data quality score, data freshness
**Weekly**: Waste trends, forecast accuracy
**Monthly**: Financial impact, ROI calculation
**Quarterly**: Executive summary, initiative recommendations
